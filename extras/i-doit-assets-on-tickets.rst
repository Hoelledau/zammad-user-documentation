Using i-doit assets on Tickets
==============================

Zammad allows you to combine i-doit assets with tickets. 
This way you'll be able to see if a device is especially unreliable.

   Use the 🖨 **printer** tab to display or add i-doit assets of a ticket.

.. note:: **🤔 Huh? I don’t see a 🖨 printer icon...** 

   This feature is **optional**;
   if you don’t see it in the ticket view,
   that means your administrator hasn’t enabled it yet.

What is i-doit?
---------------

i-doit is an assesment management tool that helps you to document your infrastructure. 
This is not just useful for IT departments, but in general every apartment that does have 
assets in some way (even air condition does count as asset!).

It basically helps you to overview those little things and fine tune it with additional 
information that help you to understand e.g. why a system has had a specific style of 
installation, even though it's not your company standard. 🙌
